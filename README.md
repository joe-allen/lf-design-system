# Design System

> A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product


> A Design System is a product which is going to help the actors of a project build other products


> a Design System is a set of deliverables
- Tools for designers & developers, patterns, components, guidelines…
- But also abstract elements such as brand values, shared ways of working, mindset, shared beliefs (which are often the most difficult thing to achieve)…

## What Is It?

1. Sketch library
2. Styleguide (think: Colors, fonts, illustrations)
3. Utliity / Pattern Library (think components: Buttons, pop ups, inputs)
4. Coding standards
5. Plus more...

## Why Do We Need It?
- Help centralize material and maintain standards among a large team
- Consistency saves times, money and instils trust in our users

## How Do We Implement It?
- Figure out who will be using it
- Align teams around shared goals
- Decide if the product / system will be loose or strict. 

> (LOOSE = There if you choose to adopt / follow. STRICT = System adoption is manadatory)

- Decide if the development of the system will be distributed or centrally managed.

> (DISTRIBUTED = Many people be contributing - Better for overall adoption, but harder to manage. CENTRAL = Easier to manage, but system adoption is slower/more difficult).

## Who Might Use it?

**COPYWRITERS**: to know how to talk 'design' / steps to take to get their vision conveyed to designers/marketers more easily. A repository of pre-approved legal stats/quotes to use.

**MARKETERS**: to ask project managers what they're needing

**PUBLISHERS**: To see what's in the works (pull in data from promo spreadsheet) and data from existing promos / pCodes (Trackasaurus data)

**DEVELOPERS**: to easily access dependents, common choice names/desc, wh/ browsers versions we support

**PROJECT MANAGERS**: to point people to correct versions of things, have some sort of 'source of truth' document/tool

**EVERYONE**: so they can grab logos, pub phone numbers / emails, pub colors, social media / commonly used images, data on promos, passwords for things we all share

### RANDOM NOTES

- Once we have our production design system ironed out we could move to another dept. (e.g. marketing, copy writer, etc)

- This is a good time to think about an organized system since we're getting 2 new gurus soon, but do not have plans to hire anymore designers/devs
